# Predicting Nitrogen Fixation in Bacteria

## Summary of Findings

## Introduction

We are using Geneious Prime to predict if certain strains of endophytic bacteria can fix nitrogen. This will be useful as a primer of Geneious Prime and the other bioinformatic tools at my disposal and show me how to analyze the data presented by these tools. The strains used were 11R-A, 11R-B1, PTD1, R10, SherDot1, WP5, and WW5.

## Literature Review

## Methods

I viewed the annotated strains in Geneious Prime and searched for nitrogenase, nif, vnf, and anf labeled genes.
